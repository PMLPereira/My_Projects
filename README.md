# My Projects

This is my python projects repository.

I will introduce new projects as I finish them.

In the first page I will have a list of the projects, score (if these are from Kaggle) and a folder with the raw data, code (.IPYNB) and markdown (.md).

List:

* Titanic Project (Score: 0.80383)

# My Projects

This is my python projects repository.

I will introduce new projects as I finish them.

In the first page I will have a list of my projects, some will include a folder with the raw data, others just the code (.IPYNB) and markdown (.md).

List:

1. Titanic Project (Supervised Techniques) 
2. Tweets by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques)
3. Patients with diabetes readmission analysis (Supervised and Unsupervised Techniques)
